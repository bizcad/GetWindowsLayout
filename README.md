## Requirements

- Windows 11 (tested on 25H2 and later)
- .NET 9 SDK
- Administrator privileges may be required

## Limitations

- This tool interacts with internal Windows APIs and may break with future Windows updates.
- Special system icons (e.g., Recycle Bin, This PC) may not always be handled.
- The app does not group icons or provide "fences" functionality like some commercial tools.

## Credits

Inspired by the need to preserve desktop icon layouts and the challenges of working with the Win32 API. Special thanks to the Windows developer community and Scott Hanselman for sharing productivity tips.
